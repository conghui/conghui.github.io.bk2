Senior Research Director, Sensetime

Research Scientist & PI, Shanghai AI Laboratory

I am currently a Research Director at SenseTime Inc., as well as a Research Scientist and PI at the Shanghai AI Laboratory. Prior to this, I worked at WeChat as a Senior Researcher, where I initiated and developed the high-performance graph computing framework, [Plato](https://github.com/Tencent/plato). Before joining WeChat, I earned my PhD degree (2013-2018) from the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. [Haohuan Fu](http://47.94.243.94/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu), and my Bachelor's degree (2009-2013) from the Department of Software Engineering at Sun Yat-Sen University.

My research interests include High Performance Computing, Computer Vision, and Large Language Models. In 2017, I was honored with the [Gordon Bell Prize](https://awards.acm.org/bell) , which is the highest distinction in the high-performance computing application domain. Currently, I lead the [OpenDataLab](https://opendatalab.com/) team, which aims to build an influential open dataset platform that facilitates the development, analysis and research of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Additionally, I oversee a data team that collects and curates massive datasets for large language models.

At SenseTime and the Shanghai AI Laboratory, we are actively hiring PhDs, postdocs, interns, and full-time researchers. If you're interested in joining our team, please feel free to reach out to me via email.
